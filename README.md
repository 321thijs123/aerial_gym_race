Aerial Gym - IsaacGym Simulator for Aerial Robots

---

This repository contains the software for simulating aerial robots in parallel, build over the IsaacGym simulator. We adapt geometric controllers to accept high-level commands to control parallelized simulated aerial robots. An obstacle randomization and management functionality is implemented to generate random environments with various classes of obstacles. 

The code for the simulator shall be released by June, 2023.
